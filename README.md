Java console program to set a computer with Windows to hibernate mode by schedule.

**How to use**

  * First, the program asks you to enter the hours (hodyny). If hibernation is not planned at hourly intervals, skip this step: enter 0 and press Enter.

  * Then enter the minutes (hwylyny) in the range from 0 to 59.

That's it! After the specified time, which will be additionally displayed in the console, the PC will hibernate. Important: do not close the program before the task is completed! If you close the program, the task will be canceled.


Additionally: if you enter 0 hours and 0 minutes, the program will ask: do you really want to hibernate the PC right now? If so: enter t (what's mean y, yes), press Enter, and the PC will shut down immediately without warning; if not, enter n, press Enter, and you will be able to set the time again.
